# Texas-Holdem
This is an implementation of Texas-Holdem the poker game written in python with several steps. First is to create the game so that 2-4 users can play. After this, a simple bot will be created following a basic 2/1 strategy. After the simple bot has been created, a deep learning bot will be built using a model to statistically best any user or the simple bot over a suffiently large number of hands played. A frontend display may be added later, for now there is a simple display using the terminal.
