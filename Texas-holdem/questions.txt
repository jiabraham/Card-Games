Small issues
How to define Ace when we're looking at straights(right now it is high with classifier=14)?
  -A striaght with an ace will be in the first 5 cards after being sorted
  -Check if straight_counter is 4, if that last card has a classification of 4, and if an ace is present
  
Should I declare functions for flush, straight, pair?
  -Declare functions for flush, straight, and multiple
  -Every hand in the game can somehow be broken down into those 3 categories

Is encoding into different classifications better than making a data structure for each different type of hand?
  -encoding is more efficient, but data structures may have been more convenient representations
How to check for straight flush?
  -Every time I find a flush, call the straight function to see if the flush is also a straight
  -Previous trouble was in a hand there can be a straight and a flush which does not result in a straight flush
  -Ex: 2H, 9H, 10S, JH, QH, KH, AC
  
 

How to make a loop to declare number of players? (is this necessary)
  -Not necessary for now because this doesn't need to be completely scalable

Big problems to tackle later
How is the display going to work?
How to create deep reinforcement learning bot to play against?
