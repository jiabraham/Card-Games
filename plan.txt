Plan:
  Global objects/data structures
  -Create a dictionary(const) of size 52 to hold the deck of cards
    *0-12 will be spades
    *13-25 will be hearts
    *26-38 will be clubs
    *49-51 will be diamonds
  -Create player objects
    *Hand(vector of 2 strings)
    *Money

  Gameplay
  -Starting the Game
    *"Welcome to Poker by Jojo" (something flashy with big font)
    *How many players?(eventually add CPU opponent)
    *How much money will everyone be starting with?
  -Functions to deal cards
    *Deal_hands(two cards per player, four players max)
      >Keep counter of how many players still in round
      >Random number generator(RNG) to give each players cards
      >Add each card dealt to cards_dealt vector(size 16)
      >Add each card to a 2 by 4 matrix to keep track of each players hand
      >Call RNG again if number yields a card has already been used
      >Finish when all players have 2 cards each
      >Call move(for every player)
    *Deal_pool (needs to take cards_dealt vector from Deal_hands)
      >RNG to burn a card(check cards_dealt)
      >Add card to cards_dealt vector
      >Then RNG*3 to give the flop(check cards_dealt)
      >Add cards to cards_dealt vector
      >Call move(for every player not folded)
      >RNG to burn a card(check cards_dealt)
      >Add card to cards_dealt vector
      >RNG give turn card(check cards_dealt)
      >Add card to cards_dealt vector
      >Call move(for every player not folded)
      >RNG to burn a card(check cards_dealt)
      >Add card to cards_dealt vector
      >RNG give river card(check cards_dealt)
      >Add card to cards_dealt vector
      >Call move(for every player not folded)
      >Call End_round
    *handRanking
      >Needs a function to find high card for hands that have equal classification
      >Need to decode classification, maybe use dictionary to map keys to strings
    *Hand_classification
      >Check for flush(if flush, check if straight or royal flush)
      >Check for straight(highest straight if applicable)
      >Check for pair(if pair, if pair check 2 pair, if pair
      check if 3 of kind, if 3 of kind check full house, or 4 of a kind)
      >Check for high card
      >Royal flush = 10
      >Straight flush = 9
      >4 of kind = 8
      >Full house = 7
      >Flush = 6
        #67(flush with highest card 7)
        #...
      >Straight = 5
        #55(straight ending in 5)
        #...
        #5A(straight ending in Ace)
      >3 of kind = 4
        #42(triplet comprised of 2's)
        #43(triplet comprised of 3's)
        #...
        #4A(for Aces)
      >2 pairs = 3
        #323(for pair of 2's and pair of 3's)
        #334(for pair of 3's and pair of 4's)
        #...
        #3KA
      >1 pair = 2
        #202(for 2's)
        #203(for 3's)
        #...
        #2A(for Aces)
      >High card = 1
        #102(for 2, not that this is possible)
        #103(for 3)
        #...
        #1A(for Ace)
  -Functions dealing with money
    *move (amount_bet)
      >Takes in string ("bet", "check", or "fold")
      >if invalid string or move print "invalid move" (adjust specificity later)
      >Adjusts amounts_bet vector(size 4) with amounts bet by all players
      >Adjust int pot (sum of values in amounts_bet)
    *End_round
      >Round ends when everyone has folded or after betting round of river card
      >Hand_classification to determine round winner
      >Increment player money by pot, pot set back to zero
      >Print round winner, print how much money won
      >Give options: play another round or end game
